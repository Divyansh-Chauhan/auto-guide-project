                           find the reason behind the trend, for example: in India we see small displacement engines because of increasing taxation
                           as per the engine displacement slab. 

                           <br> Therefore engines beyond 2000CC are very less.

                        <br>
                        We need to see the horsepower that is expected from a displacement and we can use ML to find <strong>Linear Regression</strong>
                        in the data. now we can see that "yes" there is a relation between power and displacement where power is the dependent variable.

                        <br>
                        Also at displacements like 3000CC, a lot of variability in power is present which shows that engine of that capacity can be harnessed
                        to create a large variance of power as per the suited purpose.

                            Now that we've seen what kind of engine we can create and what power it should ideally produce, 
                            now we can see as to what can we charge for that power of engine and whether the relationship can be
                            linearlly represented.
