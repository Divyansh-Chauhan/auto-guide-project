                            Customer segmentation is the process of analysing and understanding 
                            the customer in coherence to your industry. So as to catalogue
                            those customers into subgroups according to their attributes (age, sex etc.) and preferences.

                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            In B2C industries (such as the automotive industry), having the capability of putting your customers into subgroups helps in 2 ways:

                        <br>

                            by creating niche groups inside
                             a big dataset, so as to understand what kind of product will be liked by which kind of people. 
                             If companies know what will their audience like and not like, then they can do better-targeted marketing.
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                            CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) has been increasing in the past few years and becoming 
                            a “real threat” as quoted by Maruti Chairman R.C. Bhargava. Thus if a company decides 
                            to build a car and can have cheaper methods of acquiring customers then they can price themselves
                            better than the competition.

                            Knowing the size of families and understanding the age at which the size of family increases is significant in identifying 
                            the type of automobile a person might buy. That is, a person with more dependecies will requrie a bigger car with more seats whereas
                            people with smaller family sizes will be fine with cars with less seating capacity.
                            <br>
                            So having an verified assumption will help us create a vehicle for which we'll know the target customer. For example, if we're making
                            an SUV we'll know that that'll suit more for people with more Codependencies. Therefore we'll have an idea of customer segment size for whom 
                            such a product will be a perfect fit.
                            <br><br>

                            To achieve this we'll plot a boxplot to see ranges of family size in comparison of a person's respective age:

                            Behavioural segmentation is important to answer the question of "How does a person make decisions
                            and what are the sentiments that a person gives weightage to while making that purchase. In the automobile
                            industry pre purchase decisions and post purchase sentiments have significant influence on the brand image."

                            <br><br>

                            Now to analysis Behavioural aspects of humans we will understand two aspects:

                            In today's world understanding the technological expectations of a consumers from a vehicle is paramount when buidling
                            a new vehicle. This is because of the variety of consumers we have when it comes to technical saviness. Due to this reason 
                            conusmers can be fragmented with their expectations in terms of technological features, direct relation between time spent interacting 
                            with technology and saviness can be drawn. Therefore for segmentating customers we'll focus on the variability of time spent interacting with 
                            technology.
