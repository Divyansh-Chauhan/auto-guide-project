                        For the automotive industry, having an indepth knowledge of the location you're trying to sell in, helps in 2 ways:

                        <br>
                        <br>
                            <b>1. <u>Gives the industry a better sense of what kind of product will be apt for what region</u> </b>
                            as a product might be fitting in terms of the demographics and behvaiours of the population but might not be 
                            operable in that certain location. For example: a car with very high engine power wouldn't sell where roads are not 
                            good enough to take benefit out of it.

                            <b>2. <u>Helps in deciding the regions where manufacturing units could be setup</u></b> 
                            as the process of manufacturing is very intense and requires a lot of natural resources and tranportable resources.
                            Therefore a place with even a more expensive intial setup cost might be worth it in the long term by reducing running Cost

                           as those are the states with relatively bigger market size.

                           <br><br> Another qualitative analysis which can be from this data is that places with very high population densities
                           are very crowded and have already been tapped by other automakers, so due to overcrowding such places will prefer cars
                           which are smaller and easy to use.

                            In a country like India we need to understand that a part of the population is conservative as well as the other

                            see it's sex ratio as usually the states with better sex ratios have more educated population.

                            These educated populations of todays generation are usually early adopters of technology, such as EV.
                            Therefore to predict this, we'll map Indian states in terms of their sex ratios.
